// # [JSL04] Submission: Monster Ternary Operator

// #### Challenge 1: Flavor Selection

let userPreference = 'Sugar-free' || 'Regular'; // Possible values: 'Regular', 'Sugar-free', or undefined

userPreference === 'Sugar-free'|| userPreference === 'Regular'? console.log(`${userPreference} vaerity`): console.log(Regular);  



// #### Challenge 2: Stock Check

let cansLeft = 3; // Any number of cans

cansLeft < 5 ? console.log("Time to restock!"): console.log("We're stocked");


// #### Challenge 3: Workout Intensity

let heartRate = 95; // Current heart rate in bpm

heartRate < 100? console.log('Boost needed!') : console.log('Energy levels are high!');


// #### Challenge 4: Temperature Suitability
// Monster Energy drinks are best served cold. Given the current temperature, use a ternary to print "Chilled to perfection!" 
// if the temperature is below or equal to 5°C, or "Needs a cooler!" if above 5°C.

let currentTemp = 4; // Current temperature in °C
console.log(``);


// #### Challenge 5: Late Night Coding Session
// Determine if it's a good idea to have a Monster Energy drink based on the current hour.
// If it's between 7am and midnight (24-hour format), print "Unleash the beast!",
// otherwise, print "Better stick to water."

// Define the current hour in 24-hour format
let currentHour = 22; 

// Write your code below this line to determine if it's a good idea to have a Monster Energy drink based on the current hour
// If it's between 7am and midnight (24-hour format), print "Unleash the beast!"
// Otherwise, print "Better stick to water."






// In each of these challenges, the ternary operator is used to decide between two options based on a condition, 
// demonstrating its utility for concise conditional logic. Remember that while ternaries can make the code more succinct, 
// they should be used judiciously to maintain readability, especially for more complex conditions.
