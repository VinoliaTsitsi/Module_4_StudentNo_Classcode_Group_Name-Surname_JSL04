With this project I was working with the Ternary Operators. 
Ternary Operators are mainly declarative Programming they have less work and are short. 
Ternary Operators are faster than using an if else block. 

Eample: 
instade of writing this. 
 let carColor = 'black'; 

 if (carColor === 'black') {
    console.log('I love a black car!');
 } else{
    console.log('Not my favourite')
 }

 I can just write. 
 carColor === 'black' ? console.log('I love a black car!'): console.log('Not my favourite') 

 Ternary Operators make coding short, simple to use and read.
